Script that automatically plays the dinosaur game
=

## Current state: *WIP*
on my local machine screen capturing and pixel grabbing is unstable, which leads to some weird behavior.  

## Branches
*master*: working script (you'll need to modify pixel grabbing coordinates)  
my personal best is 621

*dev*: experimenting with velocity measurements, multithreaded logic and jump trajectory  
don't judge... fork and do better...  
my personal best is: 808 (main.py) 1413 (main_simple_jump.py)
